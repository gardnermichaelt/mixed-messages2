What birds whiffle through is not 
the familiar space that gives rise to your form
(In the open, there, you are denied yourself
and continue to fade without return.)

Being reaches from us and resolves the world:
that you might understand a tree in its entirety
project your inner being around it, from the presence
you carry within. Hold it with restraint.
It will not define itself. Only when it's held
fully in your presence does it become truly Tree.
